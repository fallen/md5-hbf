we use the pancham MD5 IP core made by Swapnajit Mittra <http://www.angelfire.com/ca/verilog>

Synthesis : 

It has been synthetized successfully for Spartan-3A XC3S400A
on the AVNET Spartan-3A fpga dev board.
usart output works and shows the cleartext password when bruteforcing reveals a md5 hash collision.

Simulation : 

it has been tested using iverilog (vvp) and gtkwave

More information : 

This design compares a given md5 hash with the hash of all alpha numeric strings of length equal to 8.
At the moment the hash is hardcoded in the verilog design code.

Actually, 64 characters are tested for each byte of the 8-byte string.
Those characters are : a to z, A to Z, 0 to 9, '!' and '.'
They can be easily changed by editing the file named "ram.data", each line corresponds to the hexadecimal representation of an ascii character.
Those characters are put in blockram to access them quickly and easily inside the FPGA chip.
